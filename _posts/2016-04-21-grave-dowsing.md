Grave dowsing in its purest form started in the 15th century. It was done by using a dowsing rod, which is “Y-shaped” and made out of branches. These days, it is done by using any two thin rods. You would angle these rods at about seventy degrees from the ground in your hands and keep them parallel from each other. As you would walk over a grave of some sort they would start to go towards each other and intersect. However, this is not as reliable as we would like. It was determined in the Kassel Study in 1990 that dowsing rods were expected to have a 100 percent success rate but in fact it was right 50% of the time, which meant that flipping a coin is as reliable as using these old instruments. We took it upon ourselves to design a cheap alternative for this that does not rely on superstition.

The unreliability of grave dowsing can cause sextons to sell an occupied cemetery plot or damage a grave when digging a new one. This can create legal and emotional woes for both the sexton and the families of the buried persons. If we can create a sufficiently cheap and reliable alternative to grave dowsing, these situations can be avoided.
